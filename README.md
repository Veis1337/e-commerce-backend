# e-commerce-backend

## Description

This project is an e-commerce website database, so that a business may keep relevant information about their inventory in a database.  You will need to SOURCE the schema in db, and then in the terminal "npm run seed" to seed your database. Once the database is seeded, terminal "npm start" and you'll be able to use Insomnia to do Put, Post, Delete, and Get routes. The motivation behind this project was to practice using servers and databases that can exist permanently and not just locally.  

## Installation

SOURCE the db schema file, then npm run seed.  Start the server with npm start, then run routes on Insomnia.
